# Spotify Playlist Generator

Have you ever wanted to dive deep into a genre but not sure where to start? This Spotify Playlist Generator app helps create playlists of essential albums by genre and adds them to your Spotify account.

During COVID, my friends and I got obsessed with exploring genres we weren't familiar with. While creating playists to listen to, we found it hard to easily find the must listen to albums of certain genres. We ended scouring reddit posts and music blog listacles before we could settle on what albums to listen to. This practice inspired this app, intended for the music lover that likes to dive deep into a new genre.

This app is built using the Spotify Authorization Flow https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples
